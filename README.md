### ðŸ”— HULK Language Compiler: Bridging Custom Design with C Performance

A full-fledged compiler designed to transform `.hulk` source code into optimized `.c` files. HULK is a unique academic language developed at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Havana, blending the object-oriented and strong-typing principles of **C#** with the dynamic syntax of **Python**.

This project showcases expertise in:
*   **Lexical & Syntactic Analysis:** Building robust lexers and parsers to construct Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
*   **Semantic Analysis:** Implementing type checking, scope resolution, and error detection.
*   **Code Generation:** Translating high-level HULK constructs into idiomatic and efficient C code, enabling native execution.
